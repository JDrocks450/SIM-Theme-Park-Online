# SIM Theme Park Online Restoration
An Online Server Resurrection Project for SIM Theme Park Online Protocol 1.0

## Does it work?
Kind of. Generally, I have made a nice UI for hosting a local server, so running it shouldn't be too problematic for most users. 
Setting up the game to use TPW-SE is fairly straight-forward as well. 

*Note that due to game-related issues, the game has only been seen to connect to locally hosted servers, not remote ones.*

## Setup
After cloning the repository, most code is written entirely from scratch. You should not need any extra prerequesites other than a
valid copy of Visual Studio compatible with .NET 5.0 / 6.0, and the WPF package installed.

To ensure the game connects to your server, refer to the Online.sam file, located in your installation directory */data* directory.

It should look like this: https://github.com/JDrocks450/SIM-Theme-Park-Online/wiki/Example-Online.sam-Configuration-for-TPW-SE-development

## TPW-SE / Bullfrog Protocol
I have drafted a brief resource to aid in shedding light on the packet structure that Theme Park World / SIM Theme Park used to create the 
online world seen in-game. While it is incomplete, it does contain some important details.

*Check out the Wiki for more information.*
